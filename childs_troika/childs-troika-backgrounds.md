# A Child's Troika Alphabet Backgrounds
{: .no_toc }

An in-progress collection of alliterative Troika backgrounds to help young witches and wizards learn the alphabet.

Text is draft and subject to change. Background descriptions might become more uniform, sounding alliterative and poetic. Or not.

Public domain illustrations for now; goal is to have all backgrounds illustrated in a Victorian children's book style.
