# Earth 2020X Backgrounds
{: .no_toc }

*This page catalogs an expanding collection of Troika backgrounds created using the Earth 2020X process and playlists. Text is draft at this point.*

These backgrounds are the product of a befuddled AI intrepreting Spotify as the sole source of all truth about Earth 2020X; the AI has created avatars based on song titles to send to Earth, blend in  and observe the locals. That's gonna go well...

Did I mention that the AI believes that EVERYONE on Earth has a tattoo that declares their worldview and passions?
