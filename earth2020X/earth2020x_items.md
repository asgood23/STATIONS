| 1  | Liberty bell              | A small handbell that, when sounded, kindles an overwhelming desire for freedom in all who hear it. The strength of their desire inspires them to overcome any current challenges to their freedom, however extreme.                                                                                                   |
| 2  | Sleep TV                  | Seemingly normal TV that, when watched for five minutes, causes a deep, undisturbable sleep for eight hours, during which the sleeper dreams of bizarre reality shows.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3  | Stolen moments            | Surreptitiously taken pictures of points in time, which cause them to vanish from the memory of those who experience them.

| 4  | Harmonizer                | Small, silver, two-pronged device.

| 5  | Dragonflies to sew you up | Painful but effective tool for quickly stitching up wounds; used by field medics and country doctors, abused by criminals and performance artists.                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 7  | Tiger chain               | A long, thin, lightweight but extremely strong chain that, when placed around any living creature, turns them into a tiger (barely, resentfully obedient).                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8  | Liquid summer             | Restorative elixir, smells like thunderstorms and cut grass, tastes like a first kiss. When consumed, it generates warmth, nostalgia and a subtle desire to lay on the ground, closed eyes to the sun.                                                                                                                 |
| 9  | Hypnocurrency             | Tokens of exchange that evoke intense desire and hypnotize the viewer into believing that they are real. In other words, money.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10 | Supernovacane             | Local reverse-hyper-anasthetic. The recipient feels everything surrounding them, intensely, gaining a preternatural sense of their environment and time.

| 13 | Ruler of everything       | A ruler that can perfectly measure anything, of any size or scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 14 | Wolf piss                 | Exactly what it sounds like. Used to mark territory and repel attacks territory when passing through wolf-prone areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15 | BOOTY MACHINE             | 3d printer that quickly fabricates fake, but slightly convincing treasure out of plastic.

| 16 | Ghost-Tape No. 9          | Long-sought-after iteration of the long-running Ghost-Tape series, known for its enhanced multi-dimensional stickiness for trapping or restraining ghosts in other planes.

| 17 | Champagne Smoke           | A bottle of bubbly smoke, often uncorked to inhale on special occasions, causing mild intoxication and telempathy.

| 19 | Angels Trumpet            | Small brass horn of the semi-divine. When sounded, n-dimensional psychosonic vibrations shake the sub-structure of creatures and objects in the vicinity, probing for weakness. Words fail, buildings crumble, the ground opens wide.                                                                                  |
| 20 | Snake Wand                | A simple, thin wooden wand that, when thrown to the ground, becomes a normal snake (damage as Small Beast).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21 | Paper Castles             | Small, yet intricate and expansive castles made entirely of paper. Peering inside, one sees a fully functional castle with inhabitants, decor, food, festivities and intrigue. All made of paper.                                                                                                                      |
| 22 | Light Armour              | Prismatic light surrounding the wearer, simultaneously particle and wave, liquid (when moving, +1 Armor) and crystalline (when defending, +2 Armor). Others cannot stare directly at the wearer. Lights up the surrounding area up to 15 feet. Periodically needs recharging by absorbing sunbeams or other starlight. |
| 23 | Death’s Door              | A single use object, these highly prized portals allow a single Death to pass through (either coming or going). Folds down into a small parcel, unfolds and sticks to a solid vertical surface (size as regular door).                                                                                                 |
| 24 | Sex Emoji                 | Ubiquitous across every known sphere, these small, pixelated, sentient digital icons act as familiars for individuals attempting to mate. Questionable efficacy.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 25 | Spine of God              | Nerve conduit from God’s brain to the rest of God’s body. Used to control physical functions from an abstracted electrico-chemical command center. If the Spine of God is seen in the world, this proves that God is spineless. If the Spine of God has not been seen, this proves nothing.                            |
| 26 | One Way Mirror            | When flashed at a target, casts it irretrievably into a mirror dimension.
