Spell descriptions come from an AI interpreting Spotify song titles as actual spells that can be cast on Earth 2020X.

Loosely described, spell cost listed for Troika, and some Troika-specific mechanical effects provided for some spells.

As always, make up other uses and effects as desired.

|      |                      |                                                              |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Wave of Babies (2)   | The caster waves at the target in a friendly, innocent, and utterly adorable manner; the target perceives the wave as coming from a beautiful baby, and is overcome with affection for the caster and will do their best to please them for a few minutes. |
| 2    | Sun Hands (4)        | The caster’s hands become Sun Hands, casting the blinding light of the sun in all directions and emitting incinerating heat (2d6 burn) onto anything the caster touches. The caster is generally fine, but receives a strong sunburn on any exposed flesh. |
| 3    | Phantom Embrace (2)  | The caster peers into the mind of a target human to discover a deceased person whom the target dearly misses. The target will then feel the invisible, yet tactile presence of that person embracing them for 5 minutes, causing them to release their pent-up grief and achieve a few minutes of complete peace on this earth. |
| 4    | Create Nothing (6)   | The caster points at a spot within 100 feet and makes a cutting motion with their hand. An ultra-black sphere about one foot in diameter appears for about 15 seconds. Those within 10 feet test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or get pulled into the sphere and disappear completely. |
| 5    | Drop Your Guns (2)   | Anyone within visual or auditory range of the caster immediately drops their guns. For 10 minutes, any attempt to pick the guns back up causes violent convulsions and uncontrollable weeping. |
| 6    | More Flowers (1)     | Creates many more flowers where there are already some flowers. The caster chooses 1) more of the same flowers or 2) more, different flowers. |
| 7    | Raining Teeth (2)    | Causes a downpour of teeth, from all manner of species, in all sizes and sharpnesses. Anyone caught in the open takes d6 damage. After the deluge, players may test Luck to find rare and valuable teeth (gold, dinosaur, celebrity, alien, etc) on the ground. |
| 8    | Ghost Wail (1)       | Causes loud, spooky, but basically harmless ghost wailing to come from all directions. |
| 9    | Watch the Sun (3)    | For 5 minutes, the caster can stare directly at the sun without causing any damage to their eyes (or visual apparatus). They can see, understand and describe things about the sun (and other stars) that others have never seen. |
| 10   | Max Lush (2)         | Scans the local environment and determines the maximum amount of vegetation possible, and rapidly increases the lushness to that level. Lasts for 15 minutes, after which the extra vegetation begins to wilt and decay. |
| 11   | Pattern Doubt (2)    | The caster paints a hypnotizing and confusing pattern on a surface. Anyone viewing the pattern is struck by debilitating doubt for 15 minutes. |
| 12   | Kids (2)             | The caster summons d6+1 kids to surround, distract, and generally pester the target for 15 minutes or until placated. The age of the kids summoned is d6+5. On a failed casting, the kids surround the caster instead. |
| 13   | Dance or Die (4)     | As long as the caster looks at the target and repeats the curse “dance or die”, the target must keep dancing. If the target stops dancing, they lose 3d6 Stamina per round. |
| 14   | Witch Slap (IOU) (4) | The caster directs an invisible witch hand to slap the target at some point in the future, at the caster’s choice. The witch slap comes quickly out of nowhere, causing 2d6 damage and stunning the target. |
| 15   | Smoke Signals (2)    | The caster temporarily gains the ability to smoke signals, inhaling them deeply and gaining a stronger understanding of their meaning and origin. If the signal is coded, smoking it effectively uncodes it, and the caster can blow an elaborate smoke cipher that will allow others to interpret signals similarly encoded. Repeated use of this spell is addictive. |
| 16   | Little Memory (1)    | Inserts a small, seemingly insignificant memory in the mind of the target. |
| 17   | Witness Trees (2)    | Caster can telepathically connect with trees anywhere in the world, using them as witnesses for their surroundings. Knowledge imparted is incomplete, in the language of trees. |
| 18   | Soft Spot (2)        | Caster can telepathically connect with trees anywhere in the world, using them as witnesses for their surroundings. Knowledge imparted is incomplete, in the language of trees. |
| 19   | Flow State (2)       | Creates a state of flow in something solid. Caster can expend additional stamina to increase area, duration or impact of the effect. |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
|      |                      |                                                              |
