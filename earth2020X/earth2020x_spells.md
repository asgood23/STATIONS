# Earth 2020X Spells
*This will be a constantly expanding table of spells from the [Earth 2020X - Spells playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5MFCzwtOlvJnoN1Rbljy61?si=4c8db4ba56434b63)*

Spell descriptions come from an AI interpreting Spotify song titles as actual spells that can be cast on Earth 2020X.

Loosely described, spell cost listed for Troika, and some Troika-specific mechanical effects provided for some spells.

As always, make up other uses and effects as desired.

|      |                     |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Wave of Babies (2)  | The caster waves at the target in a friendly, innocent, and utterly adorable manner; the target perceives the wave as coming from a beautiful baby, and is overcome with affection for the caster and will do their best to please them for a few minutes. |
| 2    | Sun Hands (4)       | The casterâ€™s hands become Sun Hands, casting the blinding light of the sun in all directions and emitting incinerating heat (2d6 burn) onto anything the caster touches. The caster is generally fine, but receives a strong sunburn on any exposed flesh. |
| 3    | Phantom Embrace (2) | The caster peers into the mind of a target human to discover a deceased person whom the target dearly misses. The target will then feel the invisible, yet tactile presence of that person embracing them for 5 minutes, causing them to release their pent-up grief and achieve a few minutes of complete peace on this earth. |
| 4    | Create Nothing (6)  | The caster points at a spot within 100 feet and makes a cutting motion with their hand. An ultra-black sphere about one foot in diameter appears for about 15 seconds. Those within 10 feet test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or get pulled into the sphere and disappear completely. |
| 5    |                     |                                                              |
