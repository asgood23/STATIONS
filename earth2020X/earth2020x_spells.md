|      |                                       |                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Wave of Babies (2)**                | The caster waves at the target in a friendly, innocent, and utterly adorable manner; the target perceives the wave as coming from a beautiful baby, and is overcome with affection for the caster and will do their best to please them for a few minutes. |
| 2    | **Sun Hands (4)**                     | The caster’s hands become Sun Hands, casting the blinding light of the sun in all directions and emitting incinerating heat (2d6 burn) onto anything the caster touches. The caster is generally fine, but receives a strong sunburn on any exposed flesh. |
| 3    | **Phantom Embrace (2)**               | The caster peers into the mind of a target human to discover a deceased person whom the target dearly misses. The target will then feel the invisible, yet tactile presence of that person embracing them for 5 minutes, causing them to release their pent-up grief and achieve a few minutes of complete peace on this earth. |
| 4    | **Create Nothing (6)**                | The caster points at a spot within 100 feet and makes a cutting motion with their hand. An ultra-black sphere about one foot in diameter appears for about 15 seconds. Those within 10 feet test their Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or get pulled into the sphere and disappear completely. |
| 5    | **Drop Your Guns (2)**                | Anyone within visual or auditory range of the caster immediately drops their guns. For 10 minutes, any attempt to pick the guns back up causes violent convulsions and uncontrollable weeping. |
| 6    | **More Flowers (1)**                  | Creates many more flowers where there are already some flowers. The caster chooses 1) more of the same flowers or 2) more, different flowers. |
| 7    | **Raining Teeth (2)**                 | Causes a downpour of teeth, from all manner of species, in all sizes and sharpnesses. Anyone caught in the open takes d6 damage. After the deluge, players may test Luck to find rare and valuable teeth (gold, dinosaur, celebrity, alien, etc) on the ground. |
| 8    | **Ghost Wail (1)**                    | Causes loud, spooky, but basically harmless ghost wailing to come from all directions. |
| 9    | **Watch the Sun (3)**                 | For 5 minutes, the caster can stare directly at the sun without causing any damage to their eyes (or visual apparatus). They can see, understand and describe things about the sun (and other stars) that others have never seen. |
| 10   | **Max Lush (2)**                      | Scans the local environment and determines the maximum amount of vegetation possible, and rapidly increases the lushness to that level. Lasts for 15 minutes, after which the extra vegetation begins to wilt and decay. |
| 11   | **Pattern Doubt (2)**                 | The caster paints a hypnotizing and confusing pattern on a surface. Anyone viewing the pattern is struck by debilitating doubt for 15 minutes. |
| 12   | **Kids (2)**                          | The caster summons d6+1 kids to surround, distract, and generally pester the target for 15 minutes or until placated. The age of the kids summoned is d6+5. On a failed casting, the kids surround the caster instead. |
| 13   | **Dance or Die (4)**                  | As long as the caster looks at the target and repeats the curse “dance or die”, the target must keep dancing. If the target stops dancing, they lose 3d6 Stamina per round. |
| 14   | **Witch Slap (IOU) (4)**              | The caster directs an invisible witch hand to slap the target at some point in the future, at the caster’s choice. The witch slap comes quickly out of nowhere, causing 2d6 damage and stunning the target. |
| 15   | **Smoke Signals (2)**                 | The caster temporarily gains the ability to smoke signals, inhaling them deeply and gaining a stronger understanding of their meaning and origin. If the signal is coded, smoking it effectively uncodes it, and the caster can blow an elaborate smoke cipher that will allow others to interpret signals similarly encoded. Repeated use of this spell is addictive. |
| 16   | **Little Memory (1)**                 | Inserts a small, seemingly insignificant memory in the mind of the target. |
| 17   | **Witness Trees (2)**                 | Caster can telepathically connect with trees anywhere in the world, using them as witnesses for their surroundings. Knowledge imparted is incomplete, in the language of trees. |
| 18   | **Soft Spot (2)**                     | Caster can telepathically connect with trees anywhere in the world, using them as witnesses for their surroundings. Knowledge imparted is incomplete, in the language of trees. |
| 19   | **Flow State (2)**                    | Creates a state of flow in something solid. Caster can expend additional stamina to increase area, duration or impact of the effect. |
| 20   | **Triple Dog Dare (2)**               | Summons a massive three headed dog that is d3: 1 obedient to the caster, 2 aloof, 3 hostile to the caster (damage as Large Beast) |
| 21   | **Feel Nothing (1)**                  | Target loses all sense of feeling (caster’s choice of physical or emotional) for 1d6 days. Target can ignore the effects caused by loss of Stamina for the duration. When the spell ends, all lost Stamina hits the target instantly. |
| 22   | **Higher Ground (2)**                 | The caster points at an area within range and a target; the area becomes higher ground relative to the target, with all the tactical advantages that entails. |
| 23   | **Heavy Rain (2)**                    | A massive downpour erupts in the immediate vicinity. Anyone exposed must test Luck (or Skill for Enemies) or be swept away. The rain feels strangely *heavy*. |
| 24   | **Abyss Mouth (3)**                   | The target’s mouth becomes a mouth-shaped window into The Abyss for 5 minutes, during which time the caster can converse with Abyssal Beings, asking questions, checking in, offering advice, begging for support, etc. |
| 25   | **You Are Now Under Our Control (5)** | The caster’s voice booms this statement, and all enemies within earshot believe it for five minutes, and will obey the caster’s commands. After five minutes the targets snap out of it, righteously pissed. |
| 26   | **Circle of Hands (2)**               | Summons a floating, spinning circle of 3d6 hands, each of which is a nearly perfect replication of the caster’s hands. Each of the hands can do the things that hands can normally do, but must remain roughly in a circular form. Lasts for 5 minutes. |
| 27   | **Flesh without Blood (2)**           | Target biological entity is immediately drained of all blood (or equivalent life-fluid), becoming instantly dessicated. Caster gains d3 Stamina and loses d3 Luck. |
| 28   | **Talk to the Lord (2)**              | The caster is able to open a brief, direct connection with (a/the) Lord, during which they can ask a single question. A successful casting grants a useful answer, failure results in a cryptic message that causes semi-crippling confusion and doubt for d3 days. |
| 29   | **Make Time (2)**                     | The caster inserts 10 minutes of extra time into the local spacetime continuum, either immediately before the current moment, or immediately after. If inserted before the current moment, the caster and those they choose can rewind time to 10 minutes in the past. If inserted after the present moment, they essentially gain 10 minutes of time. |
| 30   | **Internal Rain (1)**                 | The caster creates a downpour inside a sealed space such as a building, vehicle, room, or other space in which rain should not naturally occur. |
| 31   | **Constant Reminder (2)**             | The caster whispers a short reminder to the wind, nodding in the direction of the target. For the next d3 days, the target will hear the reminder every five minutes. |
| 32   | **Rabbit Hole (2)**                   | The caster creates a subtle suggestive topic in a conversation with the target. For the next five minutes, the target goes deeper and deeper into the topic and cannot talk about or do anything else. There’s a 1-in-6 chance the target reveals something interesting or useful about the topic. On a failed roll the caster is caught in the rabbit hole with the target. |
| 33   | **Vibe Check (1)**                    | By opening themselves up to the subtle social-emotional vibrations of an adjacent room or area, the caster can psychically discern the general disposition and intent of its inhabitants. |
| 34   | **Surface-to-Air Whistle (2)**        | With a melodic whistle, the caster propels a target surface into the air along with any objects or inhabitants currently residing on it. As long as the caster is whistling, the surface accelerates higher into the air. When the caster stops, the surface falls rapidly back to earth. |
| 35   | **No Mask (1)**                       | Where once there was a mask, now there is no mask. Works on masks of all shapes and sizes, both material and metaphorical. |
| 36   | **90-Mile Water Wall (3)**            | Caster summons a wall of water that is either 90 miles tall or 90 miles wide. The height is about 2d6 times the height of the caster, and lasts for 10 minutes. |
| 37   | **A/B Futures (3)**                   | The caster can conduct a rapid A/B optimization test on a decision or action in the immediate future. The caster shouts “A!” then describes one possible course of action; then, shouts “B!” and describes an alternate action. On a successful casting, a voice shouts out the correct option, which immediately happens. On a failed casting, both courses of action happen simultaneously and cause all sorts of spacetime shenanigans. |
| 38   | **Bloom at Night (2)**                | All diurnal flowers in a 1-mile radius of the caster burst into full bloom. Can be cast the day before. |
| 39   | **Fear Your Mind (2)**                | For five minutes, the target is struck by extreme paranoia and debilitating doubt as they begin to question and fear the workings of their own mind. |
| 40   | **Reverse Fall (1)**                  | While falling, the caster may reverse their fall, returning rapidly to the spot where the fall began. |
| 41   | **Dry the Rain (1)**                  | Causes all traces of rain in the caster’s vicinity to vanish completely, as if it had never rained at all. |
| 42   | **Cough Up Cherries (2)**             | The target coughs up a bountiful amount of perfectly ripe cherries for five minutes. The cherries are the most delicious cherries ever. On a failed roll, the target still coughs up cherries, but they won’t be ripe for a few days. |
| 43   | **Inside Out (4)**                    | Target object or entity is turned inside out; previously internal items or organs are still intact and functional. |
| 44   | **Full Panther (2)**                  | Caster transforms into a panther for 5 minutes (damage as Large Beast). |
| 45   | **All Gates Open (3)**                | All gates within one mile of the caster are immediately opened. Works on physical, metaphysical, databased, and emotional gates. |

| 47   | **Army of Me (3)**                    | The caster summons 3d6 copies of themself, all of whom can act in concert with one explicit objective (e.g. swarm an enemy, destroy an object, etc). Vanish into whisps of smoke in five minutes. On a failed casting, the copies still appear, but cause all kinds of shenanigans. |
| 48   | **Walls of Sound (3)**                | The caster creates up to four walls of sound, intangible but with deafening, pulsing, disorienting effects. Any creature caught in a wall of sound (or passing through one) loses two Stamina. On a critical failed casting, the wall of sound is localized within the caster’s auditorynerve network for one day, during which they can hear nothing else. |
| 49   | **Disconnect (1)**                    | The caster can disconnect any one thing from any other thing(s) to which it is bound. |
| 50   | **Footworkin on Air (1)**             | Caster floats up to 10 feet in the air, but can only perform rapid and complex footwork dance moves for the duration (up to 5 minutes). |
| 51   | **Counterspell (1)**                  | The caster summons a sprite that will keep count of a specific item or sequence for the caster, lasts until dismissed.

| 54   | **Breathing Earth (1)**               | Caster gathers a handful of earth and breathes it in; after holding the breath deeply and thinking of a question about the surrounding area, the caster exhales the answer. On a failed casting, the inhaled earth is permanently within the caster. |
| 55   | **Enter the Machine (2)**             | The caster can enter any machine, their size and form altering as necessary to allow them to do so. While inside the machine, the caster can attempt to understand and/or alter its workings. |
| 56   | Knock Knock (2)                       | Summons an invisible sprite that will knock on a door, compelling the inhabitant on the other side to ask “who’s there?” The sprite will then tell a knock knock joke; the inhabitant has no choice but to play along. Process repeats for ten minutes. |

A critically failed casting summons a very pissed off tooth fairy. |
