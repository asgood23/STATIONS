# Faceland: a Sphere of Masks, Dolls, Puppets, and the Humans Who Hide Behind Them


Two facts about Faceland:

1. Everyone is human.
2. No one wants to admit it. 

To get by, most humans do one of three things: 

* Wear a MASK. 
* Control a PUPPET.
* Possess a DOLL. 

A work-in-progress sphere for Troika, planning (at least) 6 backgrounds each for Masks, Puppets, & Dolls.

Maybe an adventure, too.
