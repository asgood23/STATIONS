# Future Music Genre Generator

What will the music of the far future sound like?

How can we hear those future genres in the music of today?

## Current State ##

[Lo-fi perchance generator](https://perchance.org/music-genres-draft) - seriously, there's basically no design here, use at your own risk(y) pleasure.

## Future Plans ##

* Nicer generator with ability to save entries and provide annotations, such as songs or artists who are "progenitors" of the genre
* Potential publication of UVG-specific version
* Album with different artists creating songs of future genres, with accompanying book by a "future musicologist"
