# Inside Dreaming Suns

![Sun Priests2.png](/Sun Priests2.png)

(illustration by [perplexing ruins](https://www.perplexingruins.com/))

I found out about the [Random Adventure Jam](https://itch.io/jam/random-adventure-jam) with about two weeks left for submissions; not enough time (for me, at least) to create an *actual* adventure, but PLENTY of time to create a bunch of short sketches of *potential* adventures (think of them as "adventure-design-hooks", and to enlist some talented Discordians to contribute.  

Below are the results of this mini jam-within-a-jam. Most of my entries skew on the absurd side, but there are more serious ideas throughout, especially from my friends on Discord. Read through for ideas, or play this like a mini-meta-adventure-design-design-adventure:

1. Get some friends together (or get yourself together)
2. Roll a dXXX and go to the corresponding entry
3. Develop the idea into a full-fledged adventure and get in touch

Seriously though, if you do want to riff on these ideas and develop something with them, just let us know; each entry has a link to its creator so you can get in touch with them directly. The rights to their words remain with them.

Thanks for reading, and thanks to [Loot the Room](https://loottheroom.uk/) for the [random title generator](https://loottheroom.uk/random-adventure-title-generator), the game jam, and the friends we made along the way.

## Howling Warrens

*There are a bunch of Warrens, and each Warren howls about a different thing. Stop the Warrens, Save the World.*  

What do The Warrens want? Why are they all named Warren? Give each Warren a thing to howl about and a type of damage their howling causes. Watch season six of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

---

## Maze Of Little Winds  

*A very pleasant maze, with very pleasant little winds.*  

Create a table of Little Winds that are really quite nice. For each entry: name of the wind, aroma of the wind, positive effect of the wind, beloved memory that the wind stirs. Also, there's a Maze that the Little Winds flow through. Make the Maze nice too. Easy ways to get in and out, plenty of benches and areas to loaf and lounge at leisure. Pleasant maze creatures and how they help you. Plentiful and nourishing food and drink. Springtime.

---

## The Coven's Deck ##

*An ancient coven's obssession with building the perfect collectible card game deck.*

What's their game of choice? (Magic? Pokemon? Um... that Vampire card game from the 90s?) How do they fund their obsession? Whom do they want to defeat? Probably include a minigame where the actually play the card game or something.

---

## Dunes Driven To The Monarch

*The Monarch has ordered the rebellious Dunes to be rounded up and driven to the palace for judgment and execution. Fight the vile Dune Drivers, defy the Monarch and ride your Dunes to freedom.*

The players are all Children of the Dunes, beneficiaries, servants, guardians of the great sentient, roaming Dunes that move about the planet bringing sand, spice and (some say) salvation in their wake. The Monarch has deemed the Dunes and their Children an existential threat to The One True Order.  Players battle the Dune Drivers and either escape or overthrow the Monarchy. Setting is basically Dune, obviously, but there are no sandworms and the Dunes are moving, sentient gods on which the Children of the Dunes live. Just steal names and locations from the Dune books. Psychadelic desert landscapes, strange plants bloom, spice flows.

---

## To Catch Dredged Churches  

*After a millennia stuck in the muck and filth of the world, ancient sentient Churches creak to life, cause havoc and evade escape.*  

What's the deal with these Churches? They need, like, motivations, stats, backstories, relationships, factions, treasures inside, caretakers probably. Are the Churches allied? Are they all of the same religion? What kind of havoc do they cause? Who is responsible for catching the Churches, and why do they always fail spectacularly at it? Bonus points for detailed Church Pursuit rules.

---

## Night to Kill the Sun  

*You and your friends have one night to kill the sun. Which is challenging because it is night and you can't see the sun and also it's really, really far away.*  

The PCs have to find a way to see and then kill the sun despite the fact that it is night. Meandering philosophical arguments about the meaning of "night" and "day." Crazed schemes due to failure. The Sun probably has vastly powerful minions that don't even acknowledge the PCs. Whose idea was it to kill the Sun again? Don Quixote meets Dazed and Confused.

---

## Outside A Defeated Reptile  

*After a month-long battle, your party has defeated a behemoth reptile god. Your comrades have entered the vast carcass searching for loot. You drew the short straw and have to remain outside, keeping watch.*  

Watch the clouds. Kick some rocks. Complain to your familiar. Think about the friends you made (and lost) along the way. Climb and crawl and explore the outside of the carcass; maybe there's some good loot on the outside? Needs a table of junk (and some treasure) found on the carcass of the reptile god, maybe a map of the carcass. Table of types of clouds and what shapes the character sees in them. Table of threats the player is supposed to be looking out for.

---

## Gods Inflame the Tooth

*A dentist office specializing in oral ailments caused by vindictive deities.* 

Basically, The Office meets Grey's Anatomy meets The Odyssey. Office foibles, pranks, tensions, romance. Someone is secretly a God. Staff is probably mix of humans and magical creatures. What are some of the oral ailments? Who certifies this office? What insurance do they take? Instead of character sheets, create intake forms. Bonus points for "tooth"/"truth" puns. Create an Into the Odd hack called "Into the Mouth".

---

## Born Into The Ancient Candlefingers  

*Unto every 7th generation a child is born with Ancient Candlefingers: a blessing, a curse, a portent of GREAT and TERRIBLE DEEDS.*  

A child has been BORN with ANCIENT CANDLEFINGERS, as the prophecies have foretold. You must protect the child from those who would destroy them, help them harness the power of CANDLEFINGERS, and ensure they fulfill their GREAT and TERRIBLE PURPOSE, whatever that is.

---

## Hot Buried Facility  

*It is said that out in the desert there is A FACILITY buried deep, real deep. And it's hot.*  

How deep is THE FACILITY buried? What happens there? Why is it so damn hot? Who runs the facility? Are they also hot? What are their stats and stuff? Who BURIED the facility and why and how and when?!

---

## Between Their Abundant Bears  

*There's a mysterious "They" who have LOTS of bears.*  

Play to find out who They are, why they have so many bears, and WHAT LIES BETWEEN their abundant bears. Bonus points for creating playbooks for every single type of bear. This is probably Powered by the (Bear) Apocalypse.

---

## To Find a Stone  

Go out and find a stone. Write detailed notes about how you did it.

---

 ## Treasure Harvest  

*Treasures planted in the ground grow into more treasure that can be harvested. This is obviously a big deal.*  

What are these treasures? By what sorcery do they grow like crops? What rituals accompany the harvesting? What's wrong with this year's harvest? What do people eat if the only thing they harvest is TREASURE? Create a very elaborate inventory management system and bartering rules.

---

## The Songsmith's Doom  

*A songsmith at the peak of their craft is DOOMED.*  

What kind of music does the Songsmith create? How many albums have they produced. What do their album covers look like? How do their fans dress? Design an entire adventure that doesn't address the Doom aspect at all.

---

## The Songsmith's Light  

Sequel or prequel or reboot of The Songsmith's Doom, focused on more aspects of the Songsmith.  

As "The Songsmith's Doom", explore all aspects of the Songsmith EXCEPT the light from the title.

---

## Aboard Shimmering Bodies  

*A peaceful microbiome of fleas, fungus and other small creatures develop in the armpits and crotches of Twilight vampires.*  

Have fun with that one.

---

## Weighing Beginnings on the Dim God  

*As a once bright and mighty God slowly dims into nothingness, their assistants huddle on the God's body and attempt to write a new beginning for the universe.*  

What domain did the God oversee? Why are they DIMMING? Who are these assistants and why are they so presumptious to assume that they can write new beginnings? How do they "weigh" these proposed beginnings? Is there like a writer's room or something? You could make this into a competitve game where each assistant has to write and pitch a unique beginning to impress the others.

---

## The Curse Layer's Hall  

*A dying Curse Layer goes on a final walk of their master's Great Hall, reminiscing about their life and laying a few final curses.*  

This one is probably more like a worldbuilding or story game. Sounds kind of fun actually. Tell the story of the Curse Layer, the House they serve, the curses they've created, and how those various histories are embedded in the Great Hall. Could make for a cool adventure location afterwords.

---

## Moon Born Into The Dungeon  

*There's a dungeon so immense it can contain celestial bodies. A Moon was born into this dungeon.*  

Damn, this one is epic! Find the Moon Born into the Dungeon and help it escape. But seriously, how? How does one even build such a dungeon, much less maintain it? How does the Moon move, how was it born? Easy way out: the Moon is personsified as are all the celestial bodies in the dungeon, in which case it's just a basic dungeon with a bunch of stars painted on it and stuff. Don't take the easy way out.

---

## In Thrall To Springs Reptiles  

*Obsessive herpetologists on spring break travel to a remote island that is just stupid with reptiles.*  

Mix of finding reptiles, studying reptiles, obsessively arguing over the characteristics of reptiles, bringing reptiles treats, etc, 1-in-20 chance a reptile is a whole new species, but then WHO GETS NAMING RIGHTS? Bestiary is just all the known reptiles. Standard island locations, all have reptiles. Also, Spring Break partying.
