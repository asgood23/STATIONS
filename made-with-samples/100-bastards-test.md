*Krustentier: "Scissor Paper Rock" by Indica*

You are a criminal mastermind but also a toddler. You wear a hat made from a squirrel you killed and a leather jacket taken from the corpse of the first man that ever crossed you.

*Kaisa: “Baby Criminal” by Viagra Boys*

## 7. Black Emperor

*The Big Jumbowski: “Brainwasher” by Daft Punk*

Start with a pet centipede, millipede, and praying mantis you swear is a reincarnated priest out to get you. You can identify any bug. Spend a Luck point to avoid being stung, pinched, bit or otherwise harmed by any kind of bug.

You are a human-sized Candy Golem intent on making the world taste good. You can peel confections from your own body that, when eaten, heal minor wounds (d6).

 *“The Candy Man” by Aubrey Woods, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (soundtrack, 1971)*

## 14. Cave Dweller

You are a cannibal. You walk on your hands as easily as your feet (+1 Dexterity). By staring long and deep at someone, you realize a truth that will refresh their broken mind. It’s empty in the valley of your heart, but you’ve left all your fears behind. Start with a noose around your neck.

[*ManaRampMatt*](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/)*: “The Cave” by Mumford & Sons*

## 15. Chainmelter

You were imprisoned for countless years, weighed down by the chains of despair and iron ones, too.

Now you seek to free all from their chains. Start with the spell *Fire Eyes*.

[*Marren MacAdam*](https://marrensmusings.itch.io/)*: “Iron Shackles” by Luzifer*

You were banished from a fallen land to a place beyond the stars. For centuries, you were lost within your own mind. You recently found your way home, riding the wings of dream. You are immune to fire. Start with a simple sword (d6) and the memory of blood on your hands. 

*Jon Neddo: “Through the Fire and Flames” by DragonForce*



## 26. Doomed Sailor & The Captain’s Corpse

You went down with the ship, abandoned by one you counted as a friend. The corpse of the captain jumped on your back, cursing you with un-life and the strength to survive until your vengeance is served. You carry the corpse with you everywhere, hear its cold whispers in your mind, feel its dank cold comfort through the night. When you are threatened, the corpse animates and blindly attacks the threat (slash/bite/stab). The corpse can be damaged but cannot be killed. 

*Starling Ridgeway: “Turkish Song of the Damned” by the Pogues*
