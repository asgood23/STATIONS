# The 100 Bastards


## 1. Ace of Spades
You are a gravedigger who dreams of winning big at games of chance. Start with your ancestral spade that can dig through any surface (2d6).

[ManaRampMatt](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/): “Ace of Spades” by Möterhead



## 2. Actress
Start with a script, a black dress, a hardened heart, and +1 Wisdom. Test Luck to convincingly impersonate anyone.

[ManaRampMatt](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/): “Cleopatra” by the Lumineers



## 3. Ancient One
You are river and stone, moaning to the moon, swooning in the sunset. Start with the spells Whisper to Water, Stone to Dust, and Metal to Rust. A lily builds a home inside your bones.

Krustentier: "Scissor Paper Rock" by Indica

## 4. Atom Heart Mother
Once per day, birth a new element: a novel and powerful combination of particles and forces. Describe the power it gives you. Once you use its power, it grows up and leaves for another dimension.

Moxie: "Atom Heart Mother" by Pink Floyd

## 5. Automatic Husband
Test Luck to become a target’s Husband. Start with a pen, an imaginary map, and a birth chart made by a special commission of Navajo basketball coaches and blonde ladies.

[Eric Swanson](https://www.instagram.com/wooodsman/),  “Automatic Husband” by Fiery Furnaces

## 6. Baby Criminal

You are a criminal mastermind but also a toddler. You wear a hat made from a squirrel you killed and a leather jacket taken from the corpse of the first man that ever crossed you. You can smoke anything, but have to nap twice a day, and always dream of building a nuclear device. Your mother is crying, somewhere.

Kaisa: “Baby Criminal” by Viagra Boys

## 7. Black Emperor

You have five eyes, all blind, but each of which can detect (and emit) a different Power: fire, static, void, sleep, storm. Start with five loyal advisers (d6+3 HP), one for each Power; they each have a spell associated with the power.

Delphi: "Fire at Static Valley" by Godspeed You! Black Emperor
