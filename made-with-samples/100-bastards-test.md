*Kaisa: "The Octuple Personality and Eleven Crows" by World's End Girlfriend*

## 84. The Guitar

You are known only as “The Guitar.” You have no other name, no age, no known place of birth or ancestry. You carry an old beat-up six string that has possessed you. You can play any song ever written; test Luck to play the exact song someone needs to hear. Any damage done to your guitar is transferred to you.

*Starling Ridgeway: “The Guitar” by Guy Clark*

## 85. The Man Who Sold the World

You are the ghost of your former self, roaming for years, searching for form and land, staring at the remnants of humanity with a gazely gaze. Start with vast wealth, hazy memories of mass death, and the belief that you never lost control.

*Moxie: “The Man Who Sold the World” by David Bowie*

## 86. The Spirit of Radio

You travel at the speed of light and cannot be seen, only heard in song and a friendly voice. You can cruise the invisible airwaves to blast out of anyone’s turned-on radio, bearing a gift without price. You crackle with electric, timeless energy. Start with the spell *Make Mood*. 

*Moxie: “The Spirit of Radio” by Rush*

## 87. Time Collector

You see time as a constantly shifting, prismatic fractal stream of crystal fragments, which you collect to replay and rearrange. Start with three cherished Time Fragments and the spell *Improvise Memory*. You can stare directly at the sun.

[*Cige*](https://cigeengine.blogspot.com/)*: “Fragments of Time” by Daft Punk*

## 88. Turbo Killer

You reside on a giant floating cyber-cross in outer space. You wear a black hooded trench coat and a gas mask with glowing orange eyes. By grasping hands with the avatar of your ship, you can manifest on a nearby planet, driving a very cool, very fast car.

*Todd A McFarland: “Turbo Killer” by Carpenter Brut,* [*music video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er416Ad3R1g) *by Seth Ickerman* 

## 89. Two-Headed Dog

You are a massive, anthropomorphic canine, and you recently lost your job at the Kremlin. You left with your severe black business suit, some important files, and the human jerky that you crave. You carry a poison-tipped umbrella (d6 damage, victims must Save or die). 

[*Robert Coleman*](https://twitter.com/tripleneck)*: “Two Headed Dog (Red Temple Prayer)” by Roky Erickson*

## 90. U<sub>3</sub>Buzz Basic

You only taste ash, smell smoke, see the world in hazy gray. You know the spells *Undo* and *Think of Fire*. Whenever you succeed at a roll, add one to your “Burn” tracker; when you hit eight, you erupt into flame that consumes you and anything you are touching, reducing you to a pile of ash. The next day, you rise again from the ash.

*D. Nivens: "Rise" by Zamilska* 

## 91. Vengeful Mariner

You have a musket (1d6), a holy relic from your time as a vestry-keeper, and your mother’s dying wish: *find him, bind him, tie him to a pole.* You start in the belly of a giant whale.

*D. Nivens: “The Mariner’s Revenge Song” by The Decembrists*

## 92. Volcano

You appear as an average human, but are actually the avatar of an ancient volcano. You are immune to heat and fire. What appears to be your skin is, in fact, a layer of magma. Anyone or anything that touches your flesh is likely to sink in and burn. Raise your fist to cast the spell *Burn the Veil*.

*D. Nivens: “"Volcano Is Me" by Raised Fist*

## 93. Voodoo Chile

You wear a Venus Witch’s Ring that allows you to exist both here and a million miles away, simultaneously. You can speak to lions and ride on eagles. Start with the spells *Desire Arrows* and *Summon Hummingbird*. Once per day you must float in a liquid garden or dust yourself with red sand.

[*Chris Air*](http://chrisair.itch.io)*: "Voodoo Chile" by Jimi Hendrix*

## 94. Wandering Stranger

You come from the sunset, from the sea, from sorrow. Cast the spell *Come Wander* to entice others to join you.

*[IKO](https://www.thelostbaystudio.com/): “Come Wander with Me” by Jeff Alexander*

## 95. Wayfinder/Waymaker

When you are presented with a seemingly intractable obstacle, test Luck to try to find a way around it. If you fail, describe how you will make your own way through the obstacle; you get Advantage on that attempt. You trust in ancient Gods and your heart of steel.

*D. Nivens: "Find a Way or Make One" by Amon Amarth*

## 96. Wayward Son of Man

You were made in God’s own image, a formless shadow. You collected splinters of bone and willed them into a humanoid exoskeleton (+ 4 AC). When you detect hollowness, conceit, or vanity in others, you may cast *Blazing Body* to ignite yourself: anything you touch must Save or be incinerated.

[*Mat Cathcart*](https://instagram.com/coughingnails?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM=)*: "Set Your Body Ablaze" by Shai Hulud*

## 97. Winnebago Warrior

You have guidebooks, a Polaroid camera, a CB radio, a folding chair, and Doritos to feed to the bears. You drive a Winnebago with a trailer full of souvenirs. You think you’re as brave as old John Wayne.

*Clay Jensen*: "Winnebago Warrior" by Dead Kennedys

## 98. Wonderboy

You come from a castle made of clouds, high and proud above the mucky-muck. You stole the spells *Mind Bullets,* *Flight,* and *Move You* from your arch-rival Young Nastyman, . 

Johnny Hall: “Wonderboy” by Tenacious D

## 99. Young Lover

You just want to love, but your daddy’s got a gun, and he’s always stalking you. Start with lots of drugs, some punk friends, and a new lover with a gun of their own (1d6).

[*Wiredscreen*](https://twitter.com/wiredscreen?t=RjZZinkMGffsMhtzNt-WQg&s=09)*: “Hayloft II” by Mother Mother* 

## 100. Zone Stepper

You can step into the Twilight Zone and stay there for up to five minutes. When you return, test Luck. On a failure, a Shade Beast follows you (6hp, shadow claw). On a critical failure a Shadow Self replaces you. Start with an obsidian blade (2d6). 

*Starling Ridgeway: “Twilight Zone” by Golden Earring*



# Bonus / Oopsy Bastards

## 1. Dirty Deed Do-er

You’ll do any dirty deed for dirt cheap. Start with three dirty deeds that you can always do (with Advantage). Anytime you do a new deed for cheap, you can do it with Advantage from that point on. You carry a battered suitcase filled with cyanide, TNT, neckties, and contracts. 

*Kerry Wilkinson: “Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap” by AC/DC*

## 2. Skull Crusher

Your clenched fists do 2d6 damage (with Advantage when striking skulls and the meatskin around them). Snorting the powder of a crushed skull gives you the being’s power for d6 years.

*Marty V: “Skull Crusher” by Man is the Bastard*

## 3. Spectra Sonic Sound

You have sugar teeth, gums that bleed, and a razor voice. You wear a fancy black suit stolen from a ghost. Start with 1d6 pieces of sticky candy and 1d6 pieces of chewy candy. You can snort confection on demand, temporarily becoming a ghost of pure sound.

[*Justin*](http://www.severedbooks.com/)*: “Spectra Sonic Sound” by Nation of Ulysses*
