**d20 conditions to receive in The Forest**

Have the adventurers unknowingly camped in an ancient druid circle? 

Has someone been magically healed a little too close to a well-worn fairy crossing? Has the party slain an ancient and sacred creature? 

The Wood is strange and unknown. The Wood is ALIVE. 

Whenever players deal in magic, the mystic, or the sacred, there is the chance that the Old Powers of the Wood will interfere and inflict (or bestow?) a strange and wondrous condition of the Wood.
