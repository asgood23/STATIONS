# Make 100 Bastards
{: .no_toc }

Making 100 Bastards (lightweight RPG classes) from your music samples.

[Currently Kickstarting](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/72stations/make-100-bastards)

When the Bastards are written, they'll all be available here, under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

We'll also work up a nice PDF.
